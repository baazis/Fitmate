# Question
We want to build a fitness training platform to allow a user to choose & book a
class.
1. Classes can be of multiple types - yoga, gym, dance.
2. Each class has a capacity. This refers to the maximum number of users that can attend
the class.
3. Users can book a class if the capacity is not yet reached.
4. If a class is already at capacity, the system should maintain a waiting list of interested
users.
5. Users can cancel the slot upto 30 mins before the class starts. When a user cancels their
booking, allocate the canceled slot to the first user from the waitlist.
